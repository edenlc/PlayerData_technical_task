# PlayerData_technical_task
Technical Task for my PlayerData Data Science  internship application

Included in this repo are: 2 notebooks, 1 python scrypt, Various Visualisations, 2 datasets.

Before running any please ensure you have the following python packages installed: pandas, numpy, PyWavelets, matplotlib, seaborn, PIL, networkx.

Please see 'Solution_notebook.ipynb' for my full solution to the technical task, including various explanantions and visualisations. To run, open in your editor of choice with notebook support and select 'run all'. If you would just like to view the visualisation, please see the 'task_visualisation' folder. 

The notebook 'data_cleaning_experiments.ipynb' also goes through the process in which I experimented with various methods of noise reduction and some various visualisations. Again, please select 'run all'. If you would just like to see the results of my investigations, please see the 'cleaning_visualisations' folder.

The folder 'datasets' includes both the original provided dataset and the dataset containing the high intensity event counts for each participant and zone.

Thanks!
